#Maze Solver AI
A web-based simulation of an AI agent solving a randomly generated maze using Reinforcement Learning. The agent learns to navigate the maze and reach the goal while avoiding obstacles and adapting to changes in its environment.

Features
Randomly Generated Mazes: Each simulation generates a new maze for the agent to solve.
AI-Powered Navigation: The agent uses reinforcement learning to learn optimal paths.
Dynamic Visualization: Visual representation of the maze, agent, and goal.
Interactive Controls: Buttons to generate new mazes and start the simulation.
Goal-Oriented Learning: The agent receives rewards for reaching the green goal.
Penalties for Failure: Optional penalties can be implemented for hitting walls or obstacles.
Technologies Used
HTML: Structure of the web application.
CSS: Modern and visually appealing styling.
JavaScript: Core logic for maze generation, reinforcement learning, and visualization.
How It Works
Maze Generation: A new maze is generated using recursive backtracking, ensuring a solvable path from start to goal.
Reinforcement Learning: The agent trains itself over multiple episodes to learn the optimal path to the goal.
Visualization: The canvas dynamically updates to show the agent's movements and progress.


1) Clone the repository:
git clone:

                                                         https://github.com/AlainBx20/AI-Maze.git


3) Navigate to the project directory:
cd AI-Maze


4) Open the index.html file in your browser to run the simulation.

Usage
Generate Maze: Click the "Generate Maze" button to create a new maze.
Start Simulation: Click the "Start Simulation" button to watch the agent solve the maze.
